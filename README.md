# Matrimony Website
Anyone can register on the wedding matrimony website and find their partner. Every user has a details page where anyone can see their information. But they can't see the contact information. If anyone needs contact information, he or she should become a premium member, or he or she can request for contact information. In that case, he or she should pay $500.
Also, every user has an individual dashboard where he or she can update her details, see requested information, and also see her favorite users that he or she added previously.
